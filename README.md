# SolarVim

Custom config for LunarVim

# How to use

```shell
git clone https://github.com/l0wigh/solarvim/
cd solarvim
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

No need to install LunarVim by yourself.

Just use my installer.

Do the LunarVim initial setup and pray for the SolarVim installation to work.
